Your_Product_Detections - GTI Widget Demo
This project is a self-contained HTML file that demonstrates a powerful integration of the Google Threat Intelligence (GTI) widget into a simulated Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) dashboard. It's designed to provide a realistic and interactive demo for customers, showcasing how GTI can enrich security data directly within a familiar interface.

The entire application is built within a single acme_siem_dashboard.html file, requiring no backend or complex setup to run.

Key Features
Realistic SIEM Interface: A clean, modern dashboard layout displaying URL and file hash matches, designed to look and feel like a professional security product.

Dynamic GTI Score Enrichment: On page load, the dashboard automatically fetches the GTI threat score for each indicator using the provided API key.

Color-Coded Threat Scores: Scores are color-coded based on severity (Red for high, Orange for medium, Green for low) for at-a-glance threat assessment.

Interactive Slider Widget: Clicking on an indicator or its score opens a sleek, resizable slider panel from the right, displaying the full, detailed GTI report in an iframe.

Secure API Key Handling: A collapsible configuration panel allows users to enter their GTI API key. The key is verified against the VirusTotal API, and its status is shown with a clear color-coded indicator (red, orange, green). The key is saved securely in the browser's localStorage.

Self-Contained & Portable: The entire demo is a single HTML file with no external dependencies beyond Tailwind CSS loaded from a CDN.
